# BlockB Card Integration

## Overview

The BlockB card has been successfully integrated into all major game systems:
- ✅ **Rewards System** - Available as a reward after completing holes
- ✅ **Shop System** - Available for purchase in the shop
- ✅ **Starter Deck** - Included in the initial deck for testing

## Integration Details

### 1. Rewards System

**File**: `RewardSelectionDialog.gd`
**Location**: Line 33 in `available_cards` array

```gdscript
preload("res://Cards/BlockB.tres"),
```

The BlockB card is already included in the rewards system and will appear as a random reward option after completing holes.

### 2. Shop System

**File**: `Shop/ShopInterior.gd`
**Location**: Line 119 in `available_cards` array

```gdscript
preload("res://Cards/BlockB.tres"),
```

The BlockB card has been added to the shop's available cards and will randomly appear in shop inventories.

### 3. Starter Deck

**File**: `current_deck_manager.gd`
**Location**: Line 19 in `starter_deck` array

```gdscript
preload("res://Cards/BlockB.tres"),        # Add BlockB for testing
```

The BlockB card has been added to the starter deck for immediate testing.

## How BlockB Works

When the BlockB card is played:

1. **Block Health Bar**: A blue health bar appears above the existing green health bar
2. **Block Amount**: Provides 25 block health points
3. **Damage Absorption**: All damage is first applied to the block health bar before affecting real health
4. **Sprite Change**: Player sprite switches to BennyBlock sprite when block is active
5. **Duration**: Block health bar clears at the end of the turn
6. **Sprite Revert**: Player sprite returns to normal when block is cleared

## Testing

### Test Scene
Use `test_blockb_integration.tscn` to verify all integrations are working:

1. Load the test scene in Godot
2. Check console output for integration status
3. Verify all three systems show "✅ SUCCESS" messages

### Manual Testing

1. **Rewards Testing**:
   - Complete a hole to trigger reward selection
   - Check if BlockB appears as a reward option

2. **Shop Testing**:
   - Enter the shop
   - Check if BlockB appears in the shop inventory
   - Purchase BlockB and verify it's added to deck

3. **Starter Deck Testing**:
   - Start a new game
   - Check if BlockB is in the initial deck
   - Play BlockB and verify block mechanics work

## Block System Components

### Core Files
- `CardEffectHandler.gd` - Handles BlockB card effect
- `BlockHealthBar.gd` - Blue block health bar implementation
- `BlockHealthBar.tscn` - Block health bar scene
- `course_1.gd` - Block system integration and sprite switching

### Block Health Bar
- **Color**: Blue (different from regular green health bar)
- **Position**: Above the regular health bar
- **Amount**: 25 block points
- **Behavior**: Clears at end of turn

### Sprite Switching
- **Normal Sprite**: BennyChar sprite
- **Block Sprite**: BennyBlock sprite
- **Trigger**: When block is activated
- **Revert**: When block is cleared

## Card Properties

**BlockB Card Resource** (`Cards/BlockB.tres`):
- **Name**: "BlockB"
- **Effect Type**: "Block"
- **Effect Strength**: 25 (block health points)
- **Image**: BlockB.png

## Integration Verification

The integration has been verified through:

1. **Code Review**: All necessary files have been updated
2. **Test Script**: Automated verification of all three systems
3. **Documentation**: Complete documentation of the integration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **BlockB not appearing in rewards**:
   - Check `RewardSelectionDialog.gd` line 33
   - Verify BlockB.tres file exists

2. **BlockB not appearing in shop**:
   - Check `Shop/ShopInterior.gd` line 119
   - Verify shop scene is properly loaded

3. **BlockB not in starter deck**:
   - Check `current_deck_manager.gd` line 19
   - Verify CurrentDeckManager is properly initialized

4. **Block mechanics not working**:
   - Check `CardEffectHandler.gd` for block effect handling
   - Verify `course_1.gd` has block system methods
   - Ensure BlockHealthBar is properly positioned in scene

### Debug Commands

Add these debug prints to verify integration:

```gdscript
# In RewardSelectionDialog.gd
print("Available cards:", available_cards.map(func(card): return card.name))

# In ShopInterior.gd
print("Shop cards:", available_cards.map(func(card): return card.name))

# In current_deck_manager.gd
print("Starter deck:", starter_deck.map(func(card): return card.name))
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the BlockB system:

1. **Visual Effects**: Add particle effects when block is activated
2. **Sound Effects**: Add audio feedback for block activation/break
3. **Block Variants**: Different block cards with varying amounts
4. **Block Stacking**: Allow multiple block cards to stack
5. **Block Duration**: Make block last for multiple turns

## Conclusion

The BlockB card is now fully integrated into the game's reward, shop, and starter deck systems. Players can obtain it through rewards, purchase it in shops, and test it immediately from the starter deck. The block mechanics provide temporary protection and add strategic depth to the card system.
