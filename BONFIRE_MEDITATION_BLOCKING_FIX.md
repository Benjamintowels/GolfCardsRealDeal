# Bonfire Meditation & Movement Blocking Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Meditation Not Triggering**
**Problem**: When the bonfire was active and the player was on an adjacent tile, meditation was not being triggered.

**Root Cause**: 
- Player detection was unreliable (only checking direct child of current scene)
- Meditation check conditions might not have been met consistently

**Solution**:
- Added recursive player search to find player in any part of the scene tree
- Added comprehensive debug logging to track meditation conditions
- Improved player detection reliability with multiple fallback methods
- Added distance debugging to help identify positioning issues

### 2. **Bonfire Tile Not Blocking Movement**
**Problem**: Players could move onto the bonfire tile, which should be blocked.

**Root Cause**: 
- Bonfire was not added to the obstacle map
- Missing `blocks()` method required by the movement system

**Solution**:
- Added bonfire to the "obstacles" group
- Added `_add_to_obstacle_map()` function to register bonfire in obstacle map
- Implemented `blocks()` method that returns `true` to block movement
- Bonfire now properly blocks movement on its tile

## Code Changes

### `Interactables/bonfire.gd`

#### Added Functions:
```gdscript
func _add_to_obstacle_map():
    """Add bonfire to obstacle map to block movement"""
    var course = get_tree().current_scene
    if course and "obstacle_map" in course:
        var grid_pos = get_grid_position()
        course.obstacle_map[grid_pos] = self
        print("Bonfire: Added to obstacle map at position", grid_pos)

func blocks() -> bool:
    """Return true to block movement on this tile"""
    return true

func _find_player_recursive(node: Node) -> Node2D:
    """Recursively search for a Player node in the scene tree"""
    if node.name == "Player":
        return node as Node2D
    
    for child in node.get_children():
        var result = _find_player_recursive(child)
        if result:
            return result
    
    return null

func _check_for_nearby_fire_debug() -> bool:
    """Debug version of fire check that returns true if any nearby tiles are on fire"""
    # Implementation for debugging fire detection
```

#### Modified Functions:
- `_ready()`: Added bonfire to "obstacles" group and calls `_add_to_obstacle_map()`
- `_check_for_player_meditation()`: Added recursive player search and debug logging
- `_process()`: Added debug check for fire detection issues

## Testing

### Test Files Created:
- `test_bonfire_meditation_blocking.gd` - Test script for verification
- `test_bonfire_meditation_blocking.tscn` - Test scene

### Test Commands:
- **L**: Light bonfire
- **M**: Check meditation status
- **B**: Check movement blocking
- **P**: Move player near bonfire
- **R**: Remove lighter equipment

## How It Works Now

### Movement Blocking:
1. When bonfire is created, it's automatically added to the obstacle map
2. The `blocks()` method returns `true`, preventing movement on the bonfire tile
3. Movement system checks obstacle map and blocks invalid moves

### Meditation Triggering:
1. Bonfire checks for player position every frame when active
2. Uses recursive search to find player reliably
3. Calculates Manhattan distance between player and bonfire
4. Triggers meditation when:
   - Player is adjacent (distance = 1)
   - Player is not already meditating
   - Player is not currently moving
   - Bonfire is active

### Debug Features:
- Distance logging when player is near bonfire
- Fire detection debugging
- Player search fallback logging
- Meditation condition tracking

## Verification Steps

1. **Movement Blocking**:
   - Place bonfire on map
   - Try to move player to bonfire tile
   - Should be blocked by movement system

2. **Meditation Triggering**:
   - Light bonfire (manually or with lighter)
   - Move player to adjacent tile
   - Player should start meditating automatically

3. **Lighter Dialog**:
   - Equip lighter equipment
   - Approach inactive bonfire
   - Should show lighter dialog

## Notes

- Bonfire blocking works regardless of active state (blocks even when unlit)
- Meditation only triggers when bonfire is active
- Debug logging helps identify issues with player detection or positioning
- Recursive player search ensures compatibility with different scene structures
