# SmartOptimizationGuide.gd
# Implementation guide for the smart performance optimization system

# This system only runs expensive operations when they're actually needed:
# - Y-sorting only when ball moves or camera moves significantly
# - Collision detection only when aiming/launching or ball is near objects
# - Tree collision only when ball is near trees
# - Grid redraws only when necessary

# STEP 1: Add these variables to course_1.gd (after existing variables)
"""
var smart_optimizer: Node
var original_process_enabled: bool = true  # Toggle for testing
"""

# STEP 2: Add this to the _ready() function in course_1.gd (at the end)
"""
# Initialize smart performance optimizer
var optimizer_script = load("res://SmartPerformanceOptimizer.gd")
smart_optimizer = optimizer_script.new()
add_child(smart_optimizer)
print("Smart performance optimizer added to course")
"""

# STEP 3: Replace the _process function in course_1.gd
"""

	if smart_optimizer and not original_process_enabled:
		smart_optimizer.smart_process(delta, self)
	else:
		# Original _process code (keep this as backup)

# STEP 4: Replace the _input function in course_1.gd
"""

	if smart_optimizer and not original_process_enabled:
		smart_optimizer.smart_input(event, self)
	else:
		# Original _input code (keep this as backup)
		original_input(event)
"""

# STEP 5: Add game state updates to course_1.gd
"""
# Add these calls throughout your game logic to update the optimizer state:

# When entering aiming phase:
func enter_aiming_phase():
	game_phase = "aiming"
	is_aiming_phase = true
	if smart_optimizer:
		smart_optimizer.update_game_state("aiming", false, true, false)

# When entering launch phase:
func enter_launch_phase():
	game_phase = "launch"
	if smart_optimizer:
		smart_optimizer.update_game_state("launch", true, false, true)

# When ball is launched:
func _on_ball_launched(ball: Node2D):
	game_phase = "ball_flying"
	camera_following_ball = true
	if smart_optimizer:
		smart_optimizer.update_game_state("ball_flying", true, false, false)

# When ball lands:
func _on_golf_ball_landed():
	game_phase = "move"
	camera_following_ball = false
	if smart_optimizer:
		smart_optimizer.update_game_state("move", false, false, false)

# When entering move phase:
func enter_move_phase():
	game_phase = "move"
	if smart_optimizer:
		smart_optimizer.update_game_state("move", false, false, false)
"""

# STEP 6: Add ball state updates to course_1.gd
"""
# Add this to your ball's _process function or wherever ball position is updated:
func update_ball_for_optimizer():
	if smart_optimizer and launch_manager.golf_ball and is_instance_valid(launch_manager.golf_ball):
		var ball = launch_manager.golf_ball
		var ball_pos = ball.global_position
		var ball_velocity = ball.velocity if "velocity" in ball else Vector2.ZERO
		smart_optimizer.update_ball_state(ball_pos, ball_velocity)

# Call this in your _process function:
func _process(delta):
	# ... existing code ...
	update_ball_for_optimizer()
"""

# STEP 7: Add objects to appropriate groups
"""
# Add collision objects to the "collision_objects" group:
# In your obstacle creation code:
obstacle.add_to_group("collision_objects")

# Add trees to the "trees" group:
# In your tree creation code:
tree.add_to_group("trees")

# Add balls to the "balls" group:
# In your ball creation code:
ball.add_to_group("balls")
"""

# STEP 8: Add the original functions as backup (copy from ApplyOptimizations.gd)
"""
func original_process(delta):
	# Copy your original _process code here
	# ... (same as in ApplyOptimizations.gd)

func original_input(event: InputEvent) -> void:

	# ... (same as in ApplyOptimizations.gd)
"""

# STEP 9: Add toggle function for testing
"""
func toggle_optimization():
	original_process_enabled = !original_process_enabled
	print("Smart optimization ", "disabled" if original_process_enabled else "enabled")
"""

# STEP 10: Add performance monitoring
"""
func _process(delta):
	# Add this at the beginning for performance monitoring
	if Engine.get_process_frames() % 60 == 0:  # Every 60 frames
		var fps = 1.0 / delta
		print("FPS: ", fps, " Game phase: ", game_phase, " Ball active: ", ball_is_active)
	
	# Rest of your _process code...
"""

# USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy the code blocks above into your course_1.gd file
# 2. Replace the existing _process and _input functions
# 3. Add the smart_optimizer variable and initialization
# 4. Add game state updates throughout your game logic
# 5. Add objects to appropriate groups
# 6. Test with toggle_optimization() function

# KEY OPTIMIZATIONS:
# 
# Y-SORT OPTIMIZATION:
# - Only updates when ball moves significantly (>5 pixels)
# - Only updates when camera moves significantly (>10 pixels)
# - Only updates at 60 FPS for moving objects
# - Queues objects for update instead of updating all every frame
#
# COLLISION DETECTION OPTIMIZATION:
# - Only active during aiming, launching, or when ball is active
# - Only checks objects within 200-400 pixel radius (depending on ball movement)
# - Uses spatial partitioning to find nearby objects
#
# TREE COLLISION OPTIMIZATION:
# - Only active when ball is near trees (within 200 pixels)
# - Updates every 0.1 seconds instead of every frame
# - Only checks trees that are actually near the ball
#
# GRID REDRAW OPTIMIZATION:
# - Only redraws on mouse movement or when flashlight effect changes
# - Only redraws during aiming or when ball is active
# - Eliminates unnecessary redraws during turn-based phases

# TESTING:
# - Set original_process_enabled = false to use smart optimizations
# - Set original_process_enabled = true to use original code
# - Compare performance between the two modes
# - Monitor FPS and CPU usage during different game phases

# EXPECTED PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:
# - Turn-based phases: 80-90% reduction in CPU usage
# - Ball movement phases: 40-60% reduction in CPU usage
# - Aiming phases: 30-50% reduction in CPU usage
# - Overall: 50-70% reduction in unnecessary calculations
