# Freeze Effect System

## Overview
The freeze effect system allows ice element golf balls to temporarily freeze gang members, causing them to skip their turn and display a visual effect.

## How It Works

### Triggering the Freeze Effect
- When a golf ball with the Ice element collides with a gang member
- The system checks if the ball has an ice element using `ball.get_element()`
- If the element name is "Ice", the freeze effect is applied

### Freeze Effect Behavior
1. **Visual Effect**: The gang member is tinted light blue (Color(0.7, 0.9, 1.0, 1.0))
2. **Sound Effect**: Plays the "IceOn.mp3" sound effect
3. **Turn Skipping**: The gang member skips their next turn
4. **Duration**: The freeze lasts for exactly 1 turn

### Thawing Process
- After the gang member's turn is skipped, the freeze effect automatically ends
- The original sprite color is restored
- The gang member can take normal turns again

## Implementation Details

### GangMember.gd Changes
- Added freeze state variables:
  - `is_frozen: bool` - Current freeze state
  - `freeze_turns_remaining: int` - Turns left until thaw
  - `original_modulate: Color` - Original sprite color for restoration
  - `freeze_sound: AudioStreamPlayer` - Sound effect player

### Key Methods
- `freeze()` - Applies freeze effect
- `thaw()` - Removes freeze effect
- `is_frozen_state()` - Check if currently frozen
- `_setup_freeze_system()` - Initialize freeze components

### Turn System Integration
- Modified `take_turn()` to skip turns when frozen
- Modified `_complete_turn()` to handle thawing after turn completion
- Freeze effect integrates seamlessly with existing turn management

### Collision Detection
- Added ice element check in `_apply_ball_collision_effect()`
- Checks for ball element using `ball.get_element()`
- Applies freeze effect when ice element is detected

## Usage

### In Game
1. Use an Ice Club or Ice Ball card to apply ice element to golf balls
2. Hit a gang member with the ice ball
3. Gang member will be frozen and skip their next turn
4. After 1 turn, the gang member will thaw automatically

### Testing
Use the test scene `test_freeze_effect.tscn`:
1. Load the test scene
2. Press SPACE to launch an ice ball at the gang member
3. Observe the freeze effect (blue tint + sound)
4. The gang member should skip their turn

## Technical Notes

### Performance
- Minimal performance impact
- Uses existing turn system infrastructure
- Sound effects are preloaded for efficiency

### Compatibility
- Works with existing gang member systems
- Compatible with all existing collision detection
- Integrates with turn management system
- No conflicts with other status effects

### Sound Effects
- Uses existing "IceOn.mp3" sound
- Volume set to -10dB for appropriate mixing
- Sound plays immediately when freeze is applied

## Future Enhancements
- Multiple freeze durations (2+ turns)
- Freeze resistance mechanics
- Visual ice particle effects
- Freeze spread to nearby gang members
- Different freeze effects for different ice types
